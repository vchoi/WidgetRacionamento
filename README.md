# RacionamentoWidget
Proof of concept Android Widget to display water rationing schedules for the
2017/2018 drought in Brasilia, DF, Brazil. This software is one of the 
requirements for the conclusion of a course on mobile app development.

The app uses location services to determine the geographical area subject to
rationing, calculates the schedule and displays it on the screen. 

## Compiling
In order to build this app you should copy gradle.properties.sample to
gradle.properties and insert your API key.

## Known problems
* Proof of concept app, definitely not ready for real world usage. Hopefully
  usable as reference. :)
* Not all rationing areas are defined.
