# RacionamentoWidget
Proof of concept Android Widget to display water rationing schedules for the
2017/2018 drought in Brasilia, DF, Brazil. 

The app uses location services to determine the geographical area subject to
rationing, calculates the schedule and displays it on the screen. 

This app is a partial requirement for the conclusion of a course on 
mobile app development. The course completion paper is in doc/ (portuguese
only).

## Compiling
In order to build this app you should copy gradle.properties.sample to
gradle.properties and insert your API key.

## Known problems
* Proof of concept app, definitely not ready for real world usage. Hopefully
  usable as reference. :)
* Not all rationing areas are defined.
